# GOOGLE site
This is my second TOP project. The task is to imitate the google search site layout (not it's functionality)

I'm starting to get some familiarity with html and css, but i still feel pretty dumb about it.
I've spent hours trying to understand why my grid layout didn't behave as i expected... turns out you DON'T have to put commas in grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows :S

This page could still be improved:
        I could add the voice search icon in the search-bar.
I       I could add animations for the top-right icons.
        I could correct the cursor behaviour on diferent elements in the page.
        I could improve the positioning to better imitate google's.

I'm not willing to do so currently, i've spent too much time on this today. Maybe next week i'll give it another go :)
